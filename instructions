Your challenge is to write and test FizzBuzz using only the C pre-processor.

Numbers that are exact multiples of 3 but not 5 become Fizz.
  eg FIZZ_BUZZ(3) --> Fizz
Numbers that are exact multiples of 5 but not 3 become Buzz.
  eg FIZZ_BUZZ(5) --> Buzz
Numbers that are exact multiples of 3 and 5 become FizzBuzz.
  eg FIZZ_BUZZ(15) --> FizzBuzz
Numbers that are multiples of neither 3 nor 5 stay themself.
  eg FIZZ_BUZZ(1) --> 1
